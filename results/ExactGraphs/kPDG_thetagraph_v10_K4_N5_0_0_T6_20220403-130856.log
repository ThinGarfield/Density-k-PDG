kPDG run arguments: K=4, N=5, TOTAL_EDGES=5, THREADS=6, idx_range=[0, 0]
Searching graphs with theta 5/4

Searching for all T_k-free k-PDGs
    K= 4 (number of vertices in each edge)
    N= 5 (maximum possible number of edges in each graph)

--------Wall clock time:  2ms
    Current minimum theta = 5 / 1
    Produced by graph: {0123>0}
    Accumulated canonicals	= 3
    Ops (vertex sig, copies, canonicalize, permute, T_k)= (6, 5, 6, 0, 5)

***************************
ALL DONE. Final result:

--------Wall clock time:  8ms
    Current minimum theta = 5 / 4
    Produced by graph: {0123>0, 0124>0, 0134>0, 0234>0}
    Base graphs processed / total = 2 / 2. Ops (copies, T_k, free)= (642, 615, 3)
    EdgeGen stats (tk-skip, bits, theta_edge_skip, theta_dir_skip, sets)= (159, 145, 156, 75, 160)
