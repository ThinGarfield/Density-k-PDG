kPDG run arguments: K=2, N=4, TOTAL_EDGES=6, THREADS=6, idx_range=[0, 0]
Searching graphs with theta 3/2

Searching for all T_k-free k-PDGs
    K= 2 (number of vertices in each edge)
    N= 4 (maximum possible number of edges in each graph)

--------Wall clock time:  4ms
    Current minimum theta = 3 / 1
    Produced by graph: {01>0, 02>0}
    Accumulated canonicals	= 10
    Ops (vertex sig, copies, canonicalize, permute, T_k)= (17, 33, 17, 0, 33)

***************************
ALL DONE. Final result:

--------Wall clock time:  11ms
    Current minimum theta = 3 / 2
    Produced by graph: {01>1, 02>0, 13>3, 23>3}
    Base graphs processed / total = 9 / 9. Ops (copies, T_k, free)= (521, 509, 19)
    EdgeGen stats (tk-skip, bits, theta_edge_skip, theta_dir_skip, sets)= (164, 16, 64, 54, 176)
