kPDG run arguments: K=2, N=3, TOTAL_EDGES=3, THREADS=6, idx_range=[0, 0]
Searching graphs with theta 3/2

Searching for all T_k-free k-PDGs
    K= 2 (number of vertices in each edge)
    N= 3 (maximum possible number of edges in each graph)

--------Wall clock time:  3ms
    Current minimum theta = 3 / 1
    Produced by graph: {01>0}
    Accumulated canonicals	= 3
    Ops (vertex sig, copies, canonicalize, permute, T_k)= (4, 3, 4, 0, 3)
    Isomorphic tests (total, true, expensive, false w/ =hash, identical, codeg_diff)= 
                     (1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0)
    Growth stats(vertices, total in step, processed in step, accumulated in step)= (2, 1, 1, 2)

---------------------------------
Growth phase completed. State:
    order=0 : collected= 0, all_edge_directed= 0
    order=1 : collected= 1, all_edge_directed= 1
    order=2 : collected= 2, all_edge_directed= 1

Starting final enumeration phase...


***************************
ALL DONE. Final result:

--------Wall clock time:  8ms
    Current minimum theta = 3 / 2
    Produced by graph: {01>0, 12>2}
    Base graphs processed / total = 2 / 2. Ops (copies, T_k, free)= (39, 39, 6)
    EdgeGen stats (tk-skip, bits, theta_edge_skip, theta_dir_skip, sets)= (16, 0, 3, 3, 20)
