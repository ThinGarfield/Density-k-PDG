kPDG run arguments: K=5, N=6, TOTAL_EDGES=6, THREADS=6, idx_range=[0, 0]
Searching graphs with theta 6/5

Searching for all T_k-free k-PDGs
    K= 5 (number of vertices in each edge)
    N= 6 (maximum possible number of edges in each graph)

--------Wall clock time:  3ms
    Current minimum theta = 6 / 1
    Produced by graph: {01234>0}
    Accumulated canonicals	= 3
    Ops (vertex sig, copies, canonicalize, permute, T_k)= (7, 6, 7, 0, 6)
    Isomorphic tests (total, true, expensive, false w/ =hash, identical, codeg_diff)=

***************************
ALL DONE. Final result:

--------Wall clock time:  9ms
    Current minimum theta = 6 / 5
    Produced by graph: {01234>0, 01235>0, 01245>0, 01345>0, 02345>0}
    Base graphs processed / total = 2 / 2. Ops (copies, T_k, free)= (2417, 2325, 3)
    EdgeGen stats (tk-skip, bits, theta_edge_skip, theta_dir_skip, sets)= (482, 568, 626, 229, 483)
