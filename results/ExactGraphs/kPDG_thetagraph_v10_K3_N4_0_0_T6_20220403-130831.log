kPDG run arguments: K=3, N=4, TOTAL_EDGES=4, THREADS=6, idx_range=[0, 0]
Searching graphs with theta 4/3

Searching for all T_k-free k-PDGs
    K= 3 (number of vertices in each edge)
    N= 4 (maximum possible number of edges in each graph)

--------Wall clock time:  2ms
    Current minimum theta = 4 / 1
    Produced by graph: {012>0}
    Accumulated canonicals	= 3
    Ops (vertex sig, copies, canonicalize, permute, T_k)= (5, 4, 5, 0, 4)
    Isomorphic tests (total, true, expensive, false w/ =hash, identical, codeg_diff)= 
                     (2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0)
    Growth stats(vertices, total in step, processed in step, accumulated in step)= (3, 1, 1, 2)

    order=1 : collected= 0, all_edge_directed= 0

Starting final enumeration phase...


***************************
ALL DONE. Final result:

--------Wall clock time:  8ms
    Current minimum theta = 4 / 3
    Produced by graph: {012>0, 013>0, 023>0}
    Base graphs processed / total = 2 / 2. Ops (copies, T_k, free)= (164, 156, 3)
    EdgeGen stats (tk-skip, bits, theta_edge_skip, theta_dir_skip, sets)= (59, 27, 27, 15, 60)
