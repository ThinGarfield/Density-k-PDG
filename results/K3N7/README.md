# Result for `K=3, N=7`

This is a single batch run using 10 threads on a 6-core 12-hyperthread machine, 
and took around 88 hours wall-clock time (therefore ~880 CPU hours). 

The log files are large.
Because github has file size limit of 100MB, the detail.log and result.log are broken
into smaller chunks after the run to make github happy.
