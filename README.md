# Compute Turan Density Coefficient for k-PDG (k-uniform partially directed hypergraphs)

The core component of this project is a general purpose computational library to enumerate
hypergraphs or k-uniform partially directed hypergraphs, to compute Turan density coefficients. 
A few examples are given to use the code to perform computational tasks that
forbids specific partially directed hypergraphs in large graphs. 

See the [Math, Data Structure, and Algorithms](doc/math_alg.md) doc for a detaild description of
the mathematical background, data structure, and algorithms used in the code. See the 
[Development](doc/develop.md) doc for information related to the development environment setup
and how to contribute. 

A significant result obtained by this code is to confirm the Bollob√°s-Brightwell-Leader k-SAT
counting conjecture for `k=5`. The result is published as Appendix A in
[this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.09233).
